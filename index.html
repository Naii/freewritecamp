<h1>Uncover your core and the story your product wants to tell</h1>
<p><strong>Who are you? What’s the core of your product?</strong> Writing has the power to reveal what’s been left unnoticed. If you allow to have an inner dialogue with your self, your true core will show. If you know who you are, you know what you want. If you’re clear about your wants you know what kind of product you want to release to the world.</p>

<div class="feature">
	<h2>Nobody cares about your product?</h2>
	<p>It’s because your story isn’t compelling enough. You need to craft a better story. <strong><a href="story-creation-masterclass/index.html">Join my Story Creation Masterclass!</a></strong> In this free email course, I show you some examples of great landing pages, how to write effective sales copy with a convincing story and offer free consulting to you. <strong><em>Don’t miss the launch on Dec 1, 2018 (Sat)</em></strong>. I look forward to greeting you in class :)</p>

<h2>The camp is a plethora of educational pieces</h2>

<p>Here at freewritecamp.org (or „the camp“), we’re bundling lots of ideas under one umbrella. The camp works decentralized. We consider the literal freewritecamp.org as the base from which you can navigate to all the important sub universes of the camp. They’re simply called tents. Every tent begins with a forward slash, e.g. <a href="masterclass/">/masterclass</a>.</p>

<p><strong>freewritecamp.org is:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li class="off"><!-- <a href="interviews/"> -->/interviews<!-- </a> --> - an interview series „How did you write…?“</li>
<li class="off"><!-- <a href="answers/"> -->/answers<!-- </a> --> - answers to writing questions on Quora</li>
<li class="off"><!-- <a href="curriculum/"> -->/curriculum<!-- </a> --> - a loose (free-form) writing curriculum</li>
<li><a href="masterclass/">/masterclass</a> - a masterclass for product creators on story creation and story marketing</li>
<li class="off"><!-- <a href="/books/"> -->/books<!-- </a> --> - book summaries; books on writing books with great lessons about writing</li>
<li class="off"><!-- <a href="lab/"> -->/lab<!-- </a> --> - an experimental lab, experiential and empiric</li>
<li><a href="air/">/air</a> - part of AIR („Institute of Applied Identity Research“)<!-- , or the other way around, I’m not sure yet --></li>
<li class="off"><!-- <a href="commercial/"> -->/commercial<!-- </a> --> - a dedicated space or tent on the subject of writing with commercial intent</li>
</ul>

<h2>Copywriting</h2>

<p>Writing for commercial purposes has a special place at freewritecamp.org because the masterclass mentioned above included copywriting as an its integral. I’m mentioning the masterclass because it’s the first tangible product out of the camp and optimizing landing page has been the most practical service for masterclass students. It’s therefore that commercial or „conversional“ writing builds the current core of the camp.</p>

<p>The offer at the camp is commercial writing and copywriting for product creators and small business with the goal to improve the copy of landing pages and increase the conversion.</p>

<p>There are many things (tools, apps, services) I could create that could help your copywriting. I’ll address those on <span class="off"><!-- a href="commercial"> -->/commercial<!-- </a> --></span>.</p>

<h2>Some words on the obsession of racing restlessness and a joyful life</h2>

<p>Besides, what you’re doing is not who you are. This is a misconception of the Western world. Who you are is who you are. <em>Without the act of doing anything, only by being a good person, you are complete and fulfilled.</em> Only when you swallow the poisonous pill (<a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/06/alan-watts-wisdom-of-insecurity-1/">real identity only through hard labor</a>) you believe you need to do something to receive the acknowledgment you’ve been longing for. You’re more than the fruits of your work. You are great, and I will show you to see it yourself. Uncover your true core and gain clarity. As a result, you will feel empowered to <strong>live a happier life and build better products</strong>.</p>
