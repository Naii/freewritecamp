<h1>Join the Story Creation Masterclass</h1>
<h2><em>Tell a better story!</em></h2>

<p>Write an appealing story for your product’s landing page so you sell more of your great goods to your customers. I give you examples of excellent landing pages and explain why they convert.</p>

<p><strong>Starting on Saturday, 2 December 2017</strong>, you will get an email from me once a week. This is sort of an open relationship, you can bond with who else you want. I know you do and I’m not jealous. On the contrary, <em>I appreciate your company and I always look forward to hearing from you.</em> Let’s make your product more successful!</p>

<h2>Sign up for the Story Creation Masterclass</h2>
