	<h1>Why donate for freewritecamp.org?</h1>

	<p>Because of products like the <a href="http://freewritecamp.org/masterclass">Story Creation Masterclass</a> (SCM) and the <a href="http://freewritecamp.org/air">Institute of Applied Identity Research</a> (AIR).</p>

	<p>SCM is an email-once-a-week masterclass where you learn to create a compelling sales story for your product in 12 weeks, and market your story in another 12 weeks. After a break in summer, you and I will review how the sales went and what could be improved in terms of your copy, pitch and content strategy. I show you great landing pages, how to write effective sales copy with a convincing story and offer free consulting.</p>

	<p>At AIR, we research identities in theory and apply them in the real world. You learn how to find your true core (nucleus) in order to live a fulfilled and achieved life. AIR derived from freewritecamp.org as a formal work-in-progress institution. AIR was founded in November 2017 also to give the students at freewritecamp.org a place that sounds more official.</p>
