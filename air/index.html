<h1>Breathe some AIR!</h1>

<p>At the Institute of Applied Identity Research (AIR), we research identities in theory and apply them in the real world. Our students, at the moment nine, learn how to find their true core (nucleus) in order to live a fulfilled and achieved life.</p>

<p>AIR was founded in November 2017 as a place to give our students at freewritecamp.org a place that sounds more official.</p>
