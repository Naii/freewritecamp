Free Write Camp is a **free, open-source community** where you learn to write professionally and help nonprofits as well as bootstrapping companies that donâ€™t take venture capital and comply with the concept of the Economy for the Common Good (ECG). The project aims to educate professional bloggers (and those that aspire to) in their writing so they tell better stories and boost their careers, while helping nonprofits and VC-free, ECG-complying startups. The project itself is a contribution to the ECG.

You start by working through a self-paced, browser-based curriculum where you learn the ins and outs of great story writing.
